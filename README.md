# Capstone-Project
This Project compresses and reconstructs data from Wireless Sensor Networks 
Three Models -LSTM,CAE and convLSTM-RNN are implemented 
Each model has an encoder that compresses data and a decoder that reconstructs the original data
The encoder-decoder architecture together acts like an autoencoder architecture
